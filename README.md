<h1>python_projects</h1>
<p>these are various projects and scripts I have been working on over the last two years and have only just recently gotten active on github.</p>

<h2>tar_archive.py</h2>
<p><strong>python3 only, currently, so you may have to install python3 env if you wish to use this utility</strong></p>
<p>currently working just as intended, with interactive compress and interactive extract, and no need to add arguments when calling it to make a file or directory archive. i intend to add edit and list functionality to it next, but that might take a week or two. if anyone uses it, let me know what you think of it</p>

<h2>calendar.py</h2>
<p>a simple proficiency proof of concept CLI calendar that you can add, view, edit and delete events. i did it as an assignment for a python class that i took a while back.</p>

<h3>ToDo List</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strike>complete the rest of tar_archive.py to make it functional</strike></li>
  <li><strike>figure out why the tar_archive.py script seems to execute flawlessly, except for the part where it should be extracting files, and it reports that it is successful, but nothing happens. so it is not</strike></li>
  <li>finish adding new features:</li>
<ol>
  <li>list contents of tar archive selected by user</li>
  <li>add items to archive selected by user</li>
</ol>
  <li>remove unnecessary pieces of boredless_tourist.py</li>
  <li>add exciting new programs and features!</li>
</ul>
