# python_projects
these are various projects and scripts I have been working on over the last two years and have only just recently gotten active on github.

<h3>ToDo List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>complete the rest of tar_archive.py</li>
  <li>finish adding new interactive functionality to tar script</li>
  <li>remove unnecessary pieces of boredless_tourist.py</li>
  <li>figure out why the tar_archive.py script seems to execute flawlessly, except for the part where it should be extracting files, and it reports that it is successful, but nothing happens. so it is not.</li>
  <li>add exciting new programs and features!</li>
</ul>
